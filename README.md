# Sustainability Score Tracker
Alexandra Ney: TB II exam

This repository contains Alexandra Ney's Tech Basics II Exam Project code.

For this Exam Project, I worked further on my TB I prototype: The Sustainability Score Tracker!

## Why did I choose this topic?

Climate change and global warming are pressing threats that endanger the planet.
Of course, governments and industries need to be held accountable for unsustainable actions, as they hold significant responsibilities.
However, as many of them fail to do so, individual actions on a smaller scale become important.
Even small efforts can add up to large cumulative effects. But since many people might not even know where to start or are overwhelmed by this complex and frightening topic, there need to be easy and enjoyable ways to overcome these barriers.
This is where the Sustainability Score Tracker comes into play!


## How it works

A new user can register or returning users can log in to their accounts.
An info page informs them how the app works: 

There are two different categories with several buttons the user can press. Each clickable option is linked to a certain number of points (5 or 10, depending on the level of “difficulty”).
In addition to the user score increasing, the app also cheers them on directly, whenever the press a button. Also, users can get more tips on how to live a life that is more sustainable and eco-friendlier. Therefore, if users don't know which small steps exactly they can take in their everyday life to counteract global warming, these tips offer an opportunity to get a deeper understanding and maybe even long-lasting commitment to environmentally conscious acts.
If everyone tries to focus just a little more on the way they live and consume, together we can collectively work to create a more sustainable and habitable world for all!
